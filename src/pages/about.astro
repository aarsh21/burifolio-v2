          Hi, I'm Aarsh Padia, a 21 y/o computer science undergraduate student.
          I love building things, playing games, and ricing my Arch Linux. I
          enjoy web development and live on the terminal. If I'm not coding, I'm
          probably losing my mind in Marvel Rivals/Valorant or watching anime.<br
          /><br />
          Beyond coding, I like tinkering with Linux, or "ricing" as people call
          it these days. I'm a big fan of Arch Linux and enjoy customizing every
          aspect of my system.<br /><br />
          I enjoy web development and have worked with various modern technologies
          and frameworks. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on challenging
          projects.<br /><br />
          In my free time, I play a lot of games and enjoy watching anime. I'm also
          active on various social media platforms where I share my work and experiences.<br
          /><br />
