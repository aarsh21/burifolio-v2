## Introduction

After months of using LazyVim as my daily driver, I recently made the switch to Zed - the modern, high-performance editor from the creators of Atom. However, I didn't want to lose the muscle memory and efficient workflows I'd built with LazyVim.

In this guide, I'll share my complete configuration that brings LazyVim-like experience to Zed, with nearly identical keybindings and settings.

## Why Switch to Zed?

Before diving into the configuration, let me briefly explain why I made the switch:

- **Performance**: Zed feels incredibly fast and responsive
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Rust and modern web technologies
- **Better Language Support**: Excellent LSP integration out of the box
- **Native Feel**: Better GUI performance compared to Neovim GUI clients
- **Active Development**: Rapidly evolving with new features

## The Core Configuration

My setup focuses on two main files: `settings.json` for general editor behavior and `keymap.json` for keybindings.

### Editor Settings

Here's my `settings.json` that replicates the LazyVim experience:

```json
{
  "vim_mode": true,
  "relative_line_numbers": true,
  "tab_size": 4,
  "autosave": "on_focus_change",
  "scrollbar": {
    "show": "never"
  },
  "indent_guides": {
    "enabled": true,
    "coloring": "indent_aware"
  },
  "terminal": {
    "env": {
      "EDITOR": "zed --wait"
    },
    "font_size": 16,
    "font_family": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
  },
  "buffer_font_family": "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono",
  "buffer_font_size": 16,
  "theme": {
    "mode": "dark",
    "dark": "Vesper"
  },
  "project_panel": {
    "button": false,
    "dock": "left",
    "file_icons": true,
    "git_status": true
  }
}
```

This configuration provides:
- Vim mode with relative line numbers (core LazyVim experience)
- No scrollbars for a cleaner look
- Indent guides for better code readability
- Terminal integration with Zed as the default editor
- Custom font and theme setup

## Keybindings: The Heart of the Migration

The most crucial part of this migration is the keymap configuration. I've recreated almost all essential LazyVim keybindings in Zed:

### Navigation Keybindings

```json
{
  "context": "Dock || Terminal || Editor",
  "bindings": {
    "ctrl-h": "workspace::ActivatePaneLeft",
    "ctrl-l": "workspace::ActivatePaneRight",
    "ctrl-k": "workspace::ActivatePaneUp",
    "ctrl-j": "workspace::ActivatePaneDown"
  }
}
```

This gives you the same window navigation as `hjkl` in LazyVim.

### File Explorer (Netrw-style)

The project panel keybindings mirror Neovim's netrw:

```json
{
  "context": "ProjectPanel && not_editing",
  "bindings": {
    "a": "project_panel::NewFile",
    "A": "project_panel::NewDirectory",
    "r": "project_panel::Rename",
    "d": "project_panel::Delete",
    "c": "project_panel::Copy",
    "p": "project_panel::Paste",
    "q": "workspace::ToggleLeftDock",
    "h": "project_panel::CollapseSelectedEntry",
    "j": "menu::SelectNext",
    "k": "menu::SelectPrevious",
    "l": "project_panel::ExpandSelectedEntry",
    "o": "project_panel::OpenPermanent"
  }
}
```

### Leader Key Mappings

The heart of LazyVim is the leader key mappings. Here are the essential ones:

#### File Operations
- `<space>ff` - File finder
- `<space>fn` - New file
- `<space>fp` - Open recent project

#### Search
- `<space>sg` - Search in all files
- `<space>sw` - Search word under cursor
- `<space>sb` - Search in current buffer

#### Git Integration
- `<space>gg` - Open lazygit
- `<space>gb` - Git blame

#### LSP & Code Actions
- `<space>ca` - Code actions
- `<space>cf` - Format code
- `<space>cr` - Rename symbol

#### UI & Utils
- `<space>e` - Toggle file explorer
- `<space>t` - Toggle terminal
- `<space>ui` - Toggle inlay hints
- `<space>uw` - Toggle soft wrap

## Advanced Features

### LSP Configuration

My setup includes enhanced LSP settings for Python and other languages:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "Python": {
      "language_servers": ["ruff", "basedpyright", "!pyright"],
      "formatter": [
        { "code_action": "source.organizeImports.ruff" },
        { "code_action": "source.fixAll.ruff" },
        { "language_server": { "name": "ruff" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### AI Assistant Integration

While I prefer keeping AI disabled by default, you can easily toggle it:

```json
{
  "disable_ai": true,
  "agent": {
    "button": false,
    "default_profile": "ask",
    "default_model": {
      "provider": "zed.dev",
      "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `<space>aa` to toggle the AI assistant when needed.

## Differences and Adaptations

While this configuration gets you 95% of the LazyVim experience, there are some differences:

1. **Plugin System**: Zed doesn't have the same plugin ecosystem as Neovim
2. **Lua Configuration**: Zed uses JSON instead of Lua for configuration
3. **Some Advanced Features**: Certain LazyVim plugins might not have direct equivalents

However, the core editing experience, navigation, and workflows remain nearly identical.

## Installation Steps

1. Install Zed from [zed.dev](https://zed.dev)
2. Create the configuration files:
   - `~/.config/zed/settings.json`
   - `~/.config/zed/keymap.json`
3. Copy the configurations from this guide
4. Restart Zed
5. Install any required language servers (Zed will prompt you)

## Conclusion

This configuration has made my transition from LazyVim to Zed almost seamless. I get the performance benefits of Zed while keeping the efficient workflows I built in LazyVim.

The keybindings feel natural, the performance is excellent, and the overall experience is very polished. If you're considering the switch, I highly recommend giving this setup a try.

You can find my complete configuration files in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/aarsh21/dots) for reference.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
